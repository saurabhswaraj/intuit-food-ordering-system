#Food Ordering System 
Implement an online food ordering system the details of
1. All restaurants have menus that list all the items alongside their price.
2. Users are shown a list of all items available on the system.
3. Users can select multiple items from this list and proceed to ordering.
4. An order is deliverable if all the items in the order can be fulfilled by at least one
   restaurant.
5. There exists a restaurant selection strategy. This is a configurable tie-breaker
   strategy which in case multiple restaurants are offering the same item selects one of
   them for fulfilling an item in an order. Thus there could be a strategy that selects a
   restaurant that is offering an item at a lower cost and another one could select a
   restaurant with a higher rating.
6. Each restaurant has a maximum processing capacity. Beyond that it wonâ€™t accept
   any further item requests until items which are being processed are dispatched.
7. Each restaurant takes some time to prepare and dispatch food. Once the item is
   dispatched the restaurant informs the system and the processing capacity
   reservation for the item is released.
   #Requirements
1. Restaurants should be able to register themselves on the system.
2. Restaurants should be able to update their menu.
3. Customers should be able to place an order by giving multiple items and quantity
   details. Ignore cart management and payment processing for simplicity.
   a. Customer here just inputs the item and its quantity,the system depending on
   the restaurant selection strategy should select and place the order
   accordingly
   a. Items of the given quantity can be served from multiple restaurants.
4. Restaurants should not breach their processing capacity.
5. The restaurant selection strategy should be configurable.
6. Implement the lower cost restaurant selection strategy.
7. Concurrency must be taken care of and demoed as well during the evaluation
   process.
